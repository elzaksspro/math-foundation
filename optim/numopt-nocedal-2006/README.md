* Jorge Nocedal, Stephen J. Wright
* Second Edition; 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

## preface
* focus on
  * continuous problems
    * cf discrete optimization problem, eg. integer programming
  * local optimization
  * large scale optimization techniques, such as
    * interior-point methods, inexact Newton methods,
      limited-memory methods, and the role of partially separable functions and automatic differentiation.
  * deterministic optimization problems,
