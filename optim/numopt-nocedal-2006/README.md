## preface
Focus on
* continuous problems
  * cf discrete optimization problem, eg. integer programming
* local optimization
* large scale optimization techniques, such as
  * interior-point methods, inexact Newton methods,
    limited-memory methods, and the role of partially separable functions and automatic differentiation.
* deterministic optimization problems
* smooth functions,
  * by which we generally mean functions whose second derivatives exist and are continuous
