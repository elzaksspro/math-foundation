# nocedal-numopt
Implementation of Nocedal's numerical optimization in pytorch

* this aims to help build solid understanding of the concept of pure opt
  (and of pytorch; note that in cpu, pytorch runs slower than numpy)
* the code is written as closely as possible with what is specified in the book
  * without (much) modification for efficiency, program design, etc
* `px` stands for `page x` on the book, eg `p128` for `page 128`
